This is an online sudoku solver. I wrote this to learn some css and javascript. 
Please feel free to point out my mistakes and inefficiencies in the code.

I did not study any theory about the Sudoku solving. I just try to simulate what I do
while solving a Sudoku.

In version 0.2, there is still the problem of trying to solve a sudoku with non-unique solution.
If there are many possibilities, recursive calls are too expensive. 
We must do an informed search (perhaps after reading about sudoku preparation ideas) to reduce
the search space.
